## Minecraft on Replit

As the title says, Run a minercraft server on Replit.com in a few minutes.

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SrEvelio/Minecraft-Replit)](https://repl.it/github/SrEvelio/Minecraft-Replit)
### How to enter the server

To be able to enter the server you will need a Ngrok key (It is totally free and you can obtain one at its [official site](https://ngrok.com/)).

Once you have your key simply put it in the Secrets section, after that simply choose the software and version of your choice in config.json. The server's ip and port will be displayed in the console as soon as you press start.

### Notes
To try to further optimize the project we started using replit's own java but this led to the fact that versions higher than 1.16.5 cannot be started, so to be able to start higher versions you have to use a different java, so to start them you simply edit the .replit file to start the start17.sh file instead of start.sh.

With the arrival of 1.21, the problem is repeated, the versions superior to 1.21 (including it), need Java 21 to work, so, now there is start21.sh to fix this small problem. 

By the way, because replit is not designed to run minecraft servers (although it is possible) these may have a questionable performance so it will not always keep 20 Ticks per second or even reach it, so this is more for curiosity and to know the limits of replit.

### Softwares
In this new version, I thought, why not put more server types and versions, so now you can choose between [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) (1.21 - 1.14.1), [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (1.21 - 1.8.8), [Mohist](https://mohistmc.com/software/mohist) (1.20.2 - 1.7.10), [Banner](https://mohistmc.com/software/banner), [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) (1.21 - 1.14), [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/) (1.21 - 1.14) and [Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/es-es/download/server) (1.21 - 1.0 [Includes Snapshots, alphas and betas]).

Now you may be wondering how to select the type and version, well it's simple, basically edit the config.json file and in each value simply put the one of your preference, by default it will come with Vanilla 1.7.10 (A classic).

```js
{
    "software": "fabric", // Purpur, Paper, Vanilla, Fabric, Quilt, Banner
    "version": "1.16.5",
    "ngrokregion": "us" // us, eu, au, ap, sa, jp, in
}
```
##

## Ngrok Regions
Ngrok allows tunnels to have different regions. Below are the values and their equivalent, so be sure to choose the one closest to your location to avoid high latency.

|Region Code|Location|
|:-------------: |:-------------:|
|ap|Asia/Pacific (Singapore)|
|au| Australia (Sydney)|
|eu|Europe (Frankfurt)|
|in|India (Mumbai)|
|jp|Japan (Tokyo)|
|sa|South America (SÃ£o Paulo)|
|us|United States (Ohio)|
|us-cal-1|United States (California)|
